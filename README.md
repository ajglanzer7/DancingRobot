# Dancing Robot

This repository is for the DiscoveryLab Summer project

## Getting Started

For project management, I recommend downloading [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) for Windows/OS X and [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/) for OS X/Linux.

After installing the environment, run JupyterLab with the following command in the repository:

```
source activate deeplearning-general
jupyter lab
```

### Prerequisites

Conda is the only external requirement for this: https://www.anaconda.com/download/

### Installing

Install the Conda environment via
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

Activate the environment via

```
source activate deeplearning-general
```
