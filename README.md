# Dancing Robot

This repository is for the DiscoveryLab Summer project

For project management, I recommend downloading [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) for Windows/OS X and [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/) for OS X/Linux.

### Prerequisites

Python 3 and Conda (for Python 3) are the only externals requirement for this: https://www.anaconda.com/download/

### Installing

Install the Conda environment via

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

Activate the environment via

```
source activate deeplearning-general
```

## Getting Started

After installing the environment, make sure the OpenCV works by running the video capture system:

```
python VideoCapture_HelloWorld.py
```

For Jupyter projects, run JupyterLab with the following command in the repository:

```
source activate deeplearning-general
jupyter lab
```
